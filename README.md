# half-elmish-oo

This is experimental.
I want to be able to create elmish loops and instantiate them as objects.
Then write viewmodels (InotifyPropertyChanged,IDataErrorInfo) on top of elmish models.

Important that this has no dependencies against any ui system.
I want to be able to use this in any dotnet app (that needs one or more states).
Wpf, winforms, avaloniaui, unity...

So yeah, so far it is experimental and i am just thinking out loud.
