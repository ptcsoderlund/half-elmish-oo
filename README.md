# half-elmish-oo

This is experimental.
What happens if we mix mvu and mvvm together?

create an async elmish program with the classic model message update.
decide what happens onNewModel (every iteration of the update loop).

Optionally create viewmodel(s) which can consume the onNewModel and create functions as getters and setters.

See example code how to implement this in a counter app.
